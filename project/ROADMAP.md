## Street View Implementation Options

### Option 1: Google Maps API (Recommended)
**Cost:** FREE for most use cases ($200/month credit)
- Most reliable coverage
- Best quality imagery
- Indoor photography available
- Setup: Get API key from Google Cloud Console
- Enable: Street View Static API + Maps JavaScript API

### Option 2: Mapillary (Open Source)
**Cost:** 100% FREE
- Community-contributed imagery
- Good coverage in urban areas
- Completely free API
- Less coverage than Google in rural areas
- Setup: Register at mapillary.com

### Option 3: OpenStreetCam (Kartaview)
**Cost:** 100% FREE
- Open-source alternative
- Decent coverage
- Free API
- Lower image quality than Google

**Recommendation:** Start with Google Maps API (free tier). It's the most reliable and you won't hit limits unless you have massive traffic.
