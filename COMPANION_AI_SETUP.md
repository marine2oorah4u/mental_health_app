# Companion AI Setup Guide

Your wellness companion AI now uses **Groq + Llama 3.1 70B** - a free, powerful AI that creates natural conversations with true memory!

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Get Your Free Groq API Key

1. Go to [https://console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)
2. Sign up for a free account (no credit card needed!)
3. Navigate to [API Keys](https://console.groq.com/keys)
4. Click "Create API Key"
5. Copy your new API key

### Step 2: Add Your API Key to Supabase

The API key needs to be stored as a Supabase secret so the edge function can use it:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: [https://supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Edge Functions** â†’ **Secrets**
4. Click **Add Secret**
5. Name: `GROQ_API_KEY`
6. Value: Paste your Groq API key
7. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Deploy the Edge Function

The edge function is already created in your project. Now we need to deploy it:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
npx supabase functions deploy ai-chat
```

That's it! Your companion AI is now ready to use.
