# New Features - AI Companion Enhancements

## Overview

We've significantly enhanced the AI companion experience with smooth animations, customizable AI behavior, and a comprehensive achievements system. These improvements make the app more engaging, personalized, and rewarding.

## 1. Smooth Animations & Loading Experience

### What Was Added
- Message animations with slide-in effects (user messages from right, companion from left)
- Pulsing typing indicator with smooth opacity animation
- Beautiful loading screen with animated greeting
- Fade-in effects for all interactive elements

### Technical Implementation
- Uses `react-native-reanimated` for high-performance animations
- `SlideInRight` and `SlideInLeft` for message entrance
- `FadeIn` for loading screen elements
- Animated typing indicator with `useSharedValue` and `withRepeat`

### User Experience
- Messages feel natural and alive as they appear
- Loading state is beautiful instead of jarring
- Typing indicator is more engaging and less static

## 2. AI Customization Settings

### What Was Added
A complete settings screen (`companion-settings.tsx`) where users can customize:

**Personality Options:**
- Supportive - Extremely empathetic and reassuring
- Energetic - Upbeat and motivating
- Calm - Peaceful and grounding
- Balanced - Mix of all styles (default)

**Response Length:**
- Brief - 1-2 sentences
- Moderate - 2-4 sentences (default)
- Detailed - 4-6 sentences

**Conversation Style:**
- Casual - Relaxed and informal
- Professional - Polished and thoughtful
- Friendly - Warm and personable (default)

**Name Usage:**

### Database Schema
New table: `user_preferences`
- Stores all user customization choices
- Defaults to balanced, moderate, friendly settings
- Updates in real-time when user saves changes

### AI Integration
The companion AI reads user preferences and adjusts:
- System prompt personality traits
- Response length guidelines
- Conversation tone and formality
- Frequency of name usage

Changes take effect immediately in the next conversation.

### Database Schema

### Automatic Tracking

- Updates progress bars in real-time

### Integration Points

## 4. Navigation & Access

### Profile Screen Updates
Added new menu items:
- **Customize Buddy** - Opens AI customization settings
- **Achievements** - Opens achievements screen
- **Buddy's Memories** - Existing memory viewer

All screens are accessible via the profile menu.

## Technical Architecture

### File Structure
```
app/(tabs)/
  ├── companion.tsx (updated with animations & tracking)
  ├── companion-settings.tsx (new - AI customization)
  ├── achievements.tsx (new - achievements viewer)
  └── profile.tsx (updated with new menu items)

lib/
  └── companionAI.ts (updated with preferences & tracking)

supabase/migrations/
  └── add_user_preferences_and_achievements.sql (new schema)
```

### Key Functions

**In `companionAI.ts`:**
- `trackUserActivity()` - Updates stats and triggers achievement checks
- `checkAndAwardAchievements()` - Private function that evaluates and awards achievements
- Enhanced AI prompt generation using user preferences

**Animation Utilities:**
- `useSharedValue()` - For smooth opacity animations
- `withRepeat()` and `withSequence()` - For looping animations
- `FadeIn`, `SlideInRight`, `SlideInLeft` - Entry animations

## Performance Considerations

- Animations use native driver for 60fps performance
- Achievement checking is async and doesn't block UI
- Database queries are optimized with proper indexes
- Preferences are cached per session

## Future Enhancement Ideas

**For AI Customization:**
- Voice tone options (warm, professional, playful)
- Context memory depth (how far back to remember)
- Proactive check-in preferences
- Response timing (instant vs. thoughtful pause)

**For Achievements:**
- Badge designs and visual polish
- Achievement notifications/toasts
- Leaderboards (optional, privacy-respecting)
- Seasonal/limited-time achievements
- Milestone celebrations with animations

**For Animations:**
- Confetti when earning achievements
- Smooth transitions between screens
- Gesture-based interactions
- Celebration animations for milestones

## Migration Notes

All changes are backward-compatible. Existing users will:
- Get default AI preferences automatically
- Start at 0 for all stats (can be adjusted if needed)
- See all achievements as available to unlock
- Experience new animations immediately

No data migration required - all changes are additive.
