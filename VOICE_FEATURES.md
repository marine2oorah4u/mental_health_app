# Voice Integration for Companion AI

## Overview

Voice features have been successfully integrated into Taskyon, allowing users to interact with Buddy using voice input and receive spoken responses. This creates a more natural, hands-free conversation experience.

## What's Been Implemented ✅

### 1. Voice Helper Module

**File:** `lib/voiceHelper.ts`

A comprehensive voice management system that provides:

**Text-to-Speech (TTS):**
- Speaks text aloud using browser's Speech Synthesis API
- Customizable voice parameters:
  - Pitch (0.5 - 2.0) - Controls voice tone
  - Rate (0.5 - 2.0) - Controls speaking speed
  - Volume (0.0 - 1.0) - Controls loudness
  - Language support (defaults to en-US)
- Cancel/stop speaking mid-sentence
- Promise-based API for easy integration

**Speech-to-Text (STT):**
- Listens to user's voice and converts to text
- Uses Web Speech Recognition API
- Real-time transcription
- Automatic stop after silence
- Error handling for microphone permissions

**Voice Management:**
- Get list of available system voices
- Track speaking/listening states
- Platform detection (web-only for now)
- Graceful fallbacks when unsupported

### 2. Voice Settings Screen

**File:** `app/(tabs)/voice-settings.tsx`

A comprehensive settings interface where users can:

**Enable/Disable Features:**
- Master toggle for all voice features
- Auto-speak toggle for automatic TTS responses
- Visual feedback for current state

**Voice Customization:**
- **Pitch slider** - Adjust voice tone (deeper/lighter)
- **Speed slider** - Control speaking rate (slower/faster)
- **Volume slider** - Adjust speech volume
- **Test button** - Preview voice with current settings

**Voice Selection:**
- List of available system voices (top 5 shown)
- Filter to English voices only
- Visual indicator for selected voice
- Platform compatibility warnings

**Visual Design:**
- Clean, intuitive interface
- Real-time preview of settings
- Color-coded switches and sliders
- Helpful descriptions for each setting

### 3. Companion Chat Integration

**Updated File:** `app/(tabs)/companion.tsx`

Voice features seamlessly integrated into chat:

**Voice Input Button:**
- Microphone icon button next to text input
- Only shows when speech recognition is available
- Visual feedback while recording (button highlights)
- Automatically fills text input with transcription
- Companion shows "listening" emotion during recording

**Automatic Speech Output:**
- Buddy speaks responses when auto-speak is enabled
- Uses customized voice settings (pitch, rate, volume)
- Volume indicator appears while speaking
- Tap to stop speaking mid-response
- Only speaks in web browsers

**States & Feedback:**
- "Listening..." placeholder during voice input
- Input disabled while recording
- Send button disabled during recording
- Speaking indicator with stop control
- Smooth state transitions

### 4. Navigation & Access

**Updated File:** `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`

Added "Voice Settings" menu item in Companion section:
- Easy access from profile screen
- Consistent with other customization options
- Clear icon (Volume2) for recognition

## Technical Architecture

### Browser APIs Used

**Web Speech API:**
```typescript
// Speech Synthesis (Text-to-Speech)
const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(text);
utterance.pitch = 1.0;
utterance.rate = 0.9;
utterance.volume = 1.0;
window.speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);

// Speech Recognition (Speech-to-Text)
const SpeechRecognition = window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition;
const recognition = new SpeechRecognition();
recognition.start(); // Begins listening
```

### Platform Support

**Web Browsers:**
- Chrome/Edge: Full support (Synthesis + Recognition)
- Firefox: Synthesis only
- Safari: Synthesis only
- Mobile browsers: Limited/no support

**Native Mobile:**
- Currently not supported
- Would require expo-speech for future implementation
- Database structure ready for future expansion

### State Management

Voice features use React state management:
```typescript
const [voiceSettings, setVoiceSettings] = useState<VoiceSettings>({
  enabled: false,
  autoSpeak: false,
  voice: 'default',
  pitch: 1.0,
  rate: 0.9,
  volume: 1.0,
});

const [isRecording, setIsRecording] = useState(false);
const [isSpeaking, setIsSpeaking] = useState(false);
```

Settings are persisted in Supabase user_preferences table as JSON:
```sql
voice_settings jsonb
```

## User Experience Flow

### Voice Input Flow

1. User taps microphone button
2. Browser requests microphone permission (first time)
3. Button highlights, companion shows "listening" emotion
4. User speaks their message
5. Speech recognition stops automatically after silence
6. Transcript appears in text input
7. User can edit transcript or send immediately

### Voice Output Flow

1. User sends message
2. Buddy generates AI response
3. Response displays in chat
4. If auto-speak is enabled:
   - Volume indicator appears
   - Buddy speaks response aloud
   - User can tap to stop mid-speech
5. Speaking completes naturally

### Settings Configuration Flow

1. User opens Profile → Voice Settings
2. Enables voice features
3. Adjusts pitch/speed/volume sliders
4. Taps "Test Voice" to preview
5. Optionally selects different system voice
6. Enables auto-speak if desired
7. Saves settings → Syncs to database

## Code Examples

### Using Voice Input in Chat

```typescript
const handleVoiceInput = async () => {
  if (!voiceHelper.isRecognitionAvailable()) return;

  try {
    setIsRecording(true);
    setCompanionEmotion('listening');

    const transcript = await voiceHelper.listen();

    setInputText(transcript);
    setIsRecording(false);
    setCompanionEmotion('idle');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Voice input error:', error);
    setIsRecording(false);
    setCompanionEmotion('idle');
  }
};
```

### Speaking AI Responses

```typescript
const speakResponse = async (text: string) => {
  if (!voiceSettings.enabled || !voiceHelper.isAvailable()) return;

  try {
    setIsSpeaking(true);
    await voiceHelper.speak(text, {
      pitch: voiceSettings.pitch,
      rate: voiceSettings.rate,
      volume: voiceSettings.volume,
    });
    setIsSpeaking(false);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Speech error:', error);
    setIsSpeaking(false);
  }
};
```

## Database Schema

Voice settings are stored in the `user_preferences` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_preferences (
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  -- ... other preferences ...
  voice_settings jsonb DEFAULT NULL,
  -- ... timestamps ...
);
```

Example voice_settings JSON:
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "autoSpeak": true,
  "voice": "Google US English",
  "pitch": 1.1,
  "rate": 0.9,
  "volume": 0.8
}
```
