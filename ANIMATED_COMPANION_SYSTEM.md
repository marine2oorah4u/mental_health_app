   - Default: Medium-sized orb, stylized cozy room, day time, clear weather

2. **Customization:**
   - User opens Customize Appearance ‚Üí Designs companion look

### Emotion Detection System

**User Message Analysis:**

  ‚Üí Companion shows 'happy' emotion

// Sad/anxious emotions
if (msg.includes('sad' | 'anxious' | 'worried' | 'depressed'))
  ‚Üí Companion shows 'concerned' emotion

// Achievements
if (achievement unlocked)
  ‚Üí Companion shows 'celebrating' emotion

// Default states
- User typing ‚Üí 'listening'
- AI responding ‚Üí 'speaking'
- No activity ‚Üí 'idle'
```

## Database Details
