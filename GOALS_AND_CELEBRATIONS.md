# Goals & Celebrations System

## Overview

Added a comprehensive goal-setting system and beautiful achievement celebrations to make progress feel rewarding and meaningful.

## âœ… What Was Fixed

### Bottom Padding Issue
- **Problem**: Input area and bottom navigation were getting cropped
- **Solution**: Increased bottom padding from 24px to 32px + added 20px spacer
- **Result**: All UI elements now fully visible with proper spacing

## ðŸŽ‰ Achievement Celebrations

### Visual Design
Created a beautiful celebration modal (`AchievementCelebration.tsx`) that shows when users unlock achievements:

**Features:**
- **Confetti Animation**: 40 colorful confetti pieces that fall and rotate
  - Random colors: gold, red, teal, blue, orange
  - Smooth bezier easing for natural fall
  - 2-second fall duration with rotation
- **Modal Card**: Elegant card with spring animation
  - Icon bounces on entry (scale 1.2 â†’ 1)
  - Category-color-coded icon background
  - Clear achievement name and description
  - Points badge showing reward
- **Auto-dismiss**: Celebration shows for 4 seconds then fades out
- **No Fast Flashes**: All animations are smooth and comfortable (500-800ms durations)

**Colors by Category:**
- Engagement: Blue (#3B82F6)
- Wellness: Green (#10B981)
- Milestone: Orange (#F59E0B)
- Special: Purple (#8B5CF6)

### How to Use
```typescript
import AchievementCelebration from '@/components/AchievementCelebration';

<AchievementCelebration
  achievement={{
    name: 'First Steps',
    description: 'Started your first conversation',
    points: 10,
    category: 'engagement'
  }}
  onDismiss={() => setAchievement(null)}
/>
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals System

### Database Schema

**Table: `user_goals`**
- Stores user-defined goals created naturally through conversation
- Fields:
  - `title` - Short goal description
  - `description` - Detailed explanation
  - `category` - wellness, habit, milestone, personal, other
  - `target_date` - Optional deadline
  - `status` - active, completed, paused, abandoned
  - `progress_notes` - JSONB array of check-ins
  - Timestamps for created, updated, completed

**Table: `goal_check_ins`**
- Tracks progress updates from conversations
- Fields:
  - `note` - Progress update
  - `sentiment` - positive, neutral, struggling
  - `created_at` - When the check-in happened

### Goal Functions

**Create a Goal:**
```typescript
import { createUserGoal } from '@/lib/companionAI';

const goalId = await createUserGoal(
  userId,
  'Exercise 3 times per week',
  'Build a consistent fitness habit',
  'wellness'
);
```

**Get User Goals:**
```typescript
import { getUserGoals } from '@/lib/companionAI';

const activeGoals = await getUserGoals(userId, 'active');
const completed = await getUserGoals(userId, 'completed');
const all = await getUserGoals(userId, 'all');
```

**Add Progress Check-In:**
```typescript
import { addGoalCheckIn } from '@/lib/companionAI';

await addGoalCheckIn(
  userId,
  goalId,
  'Worked out today! Feeling great.',
  'positive'
);
```

**Complete a Goal:**
```typescript
import { completeGoal } from '@/lib/companionAI';

await completeGoal(userId, goalId);
// Automatically checks for "Goal Crusher" achievement
```

## ðŸ¤– Natural Goal Integration with Buddy

### How It Works

Buddy can naturally help users set and track goals through conversation. The system detects when users mention:
- "I want to..."
- "My goal is..."
- "I'm trying to..."
- "I hope to..."

### Example Conversations

**Setting a Goal:**
```
User: I want to start meditating every day
Buddy: That's a wonderful goal! Daily meditation can really help with
      mental clarity and stress. Should we make that an official goal
      so I can help you track it?
User: Yes!
Buddy: Perfect! I've created your goal: "Meditate daily". I'll check
      in with you about it regularly. How does that feel?
```

**Progress Check-ins:**
```
User: I meditated today!
Buddy: That's fantastic! I'm so proud of you. How did it feel?
      [System logs positive check-in for meditation goal]
```

**Completing Goals:**
```
User: I've been meditating for 30 days straight!
Buddy: Wow! That's incredible dedication. You've built a real habit.
      Should we mark your meditation goal as completed and maybe set
      a new challenge?
      [System marks goal complete, checks for achievements]
      ðŸŽ‰ Achievement Unlocked: Goal Crusher! +75 pts
```
