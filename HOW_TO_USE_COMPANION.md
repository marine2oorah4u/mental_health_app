## 💬 How to Chat with Buddy

### First Conversation (Onboarding)
When you first chat with Buddy, you'll go through a brief getting-to-know-you phase:

1. **Buddy asks your name** - Just respond naturally ("I'm Alex" or "Call me Sarah")
2. **Buddy asks what brings you here** - Share what's on your mind
3. **Buddy asks follow-up questions** - To understand how to best support you
4. **After 3-4 exchanges** - Onboarding is complete, and future chats will be more natural

### Ongoing Conversations
After onboarding, chat freely about anything:
- How you're feeling today
- Something exciting that happened
- A struggle you're facing
- A goal you're working towards
- Just venting about your day

**Buddy will:**
- Greet you by name
- Reference things you've shared before
